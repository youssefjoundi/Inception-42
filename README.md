## What is Docker?

Docker is a containerization platform that allows you to package an application and its dependencies into a single container. Containers are lightweight and can run consistently across different environments, making it easier to deploy and manage applications.

## Installation

To get started with Docker, you need to install Docker on your system. Follow the installation instructions for your specific operating system:

- [Docker Desktop for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/)
- [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/)
- [Docker Engine for Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

## Usage

Once Docker is installed, you can start using it. Here are some common Docker commands:

### Build and run the containers

```bash
make
```
### Remove the running containers
```bash
make clear
```
### Clear cache and remove all volumes 
```bash
make fclear
```
